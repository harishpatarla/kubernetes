0. Visitor Pattern:

Allows operations to be performed on object structures without modifying them.

1. Template Method Pattern:

Outlines an algorithm’s structure while letting subclasses implement specific steps.

2. Strategy Pattern:

Enables a choice of algorithms at runtime within a family of interchangeable algorithms.

3. State Pattern:

Changes object behavior based on its internal state, mimicking class changes.

4. Observer Pattern:

Updates dependent objects automatically when one object changes state.

5. Memento Pattern:

Saves and restores an object's state without exposing its structure.

6. Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

Passes requests along a chain of potential handlers until processed.

7. Command Pattern:

Wraps requests as objects, enabling parameterization and operational extensions like undo.

8. Interpreter Pattern:

Implements a language interpreter for predefined grammar.

9. Iterator Pattern:

Provides sequential access to elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure.

10. Mediator Pattern:

Centralizes complex communications and control between related objects.

11. Adapter Pattern:

Adapts an existing interface into one that a client expects.

12. Bridge Pattern:

Separates an object’s interface from its implementation, allowing both to vary.

13. Composite Pattern:

Manages a hierarchical collection of objects through a uniform interface.

14. Decorator Pattern:

Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

15. Facade Pattern:

Simplifies a system’s interface through a single unified access point.

16. Flyweight Pattern:

Manages fine-grained objects efficiently through sharing.

17. Proxy Pattern:

Controls object access, adding a layer of indirection.

# Creational patterns:
18. Singleton Pattern:

Restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global access point.


19. Prototype Pattern:

Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.

20. Factory Method Pattern:

Delegates the instantiation of objects to subclasses. 
we need to pass all parameters before calling the method, if we need more flexibility we can use builder pattern.

21. Builder Pattern:

Constructs complex objects step-by-step, separating construction and representation.

22. Abstract Factory Pattern:

Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
